Battery drains faster when it's moderate usage. 33w charger is the only plus.Phone feels little heavier while comparing other phones at this price segment.OnePlus logo is not clearly visible at backside.Some features like \"Google Service for VR\" is not working in this model.Overall I can give 3 rating out of 5.READ MORE\n",
